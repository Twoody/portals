	Has Been resolved, but did not mention in commit log :|

	The great cleanup continues;
	It is important to note that we are managing hrefs in res/strings/href.php;
	It is also important to note that u/actions/index.php is our current leader
	in condensing everything...;
	That is, we are still fixing up the index.php pages;

	All GEN updates are in place where we need them;
	Now, I am going through and wrapping those spots in specific hrefs,
		cols, rows, and container functions;
	The current action is to go through the rest of the pages, making amends to
		place the content in strings.php, href.php, and the such;
	After that, I will need to think about the href file and whether this is best with
	multiple and organized function calls, or if that is to cost heavy.
	The other option is to place the href calls in a function and make the necessary param calls;

	Inventory is all put together such that a user can continue to add to their
	cart. Next, is to allow the user to view their cart and to manage the items 
	within the cart;
	Part of this is to create a shopid and build that into where the user is 
	purchasing the item;

	Viewport, tables, and all of that jazz look like they are good to go.
	Next, I will be creating a modal to update an inventory when logged in
		as an owner.
	I will duplicate everything I have done for admin to a o/ dir.;
	In that dir, I will focus on making a table that portrays something...
	And we will be able to add entries to that table, just like we can
		delete entries from the users table as an admin;
	Finally, members will be able to see what is available based on owners
	choosing;

	Got a registration page up and running to just make new members.
	Next is putting together a viewport difference between members and owner;
	This viewport can use datatables and tabs between active items and 
		inactive items.
	There will be an option to add an item to both inactive and active.

	Amended all of the imports so content is loading cross directories;
	Cleanded up some poor placed logic in regards to order of operations;
	Compiled css/bootstrap.php s.t. it runs stand-alone:
		clear && php css/bootstrap.php
	**Note that running this does require the testing environemtn to be 
		activated; Next is to get alls js/ and css/ files in a similar place;
	Finally, working on getting SESSIONS and login screen to behave as expected;

	Form submission is up for logins;
	We are currently `under maintenace` as we have not configured the db;
	That being said, everything works even if the DB is compromised;
	TODO:
		add `tables` param to config to set cols;
		init tables via db_helper;
		do a verification if users exist in `users` table;
		init users via db_helper if no users found;
		Test Login!
	And once logins are up and running, consider next part of task.
		Either (A) Do Json parser or (B) Work on the design of the site via navbar and the such;

	Have everything in place to start initializing the db;
	Still working in /templates/login.php:
		Do a verification if the DB exists;
		Do a verification if the TABLES exist;
		Do a verification if USERS exist;
	After verification, act accordingly in making the db, making tables, or updating db;
	Once this is done, we should be in place for a navbar template;
