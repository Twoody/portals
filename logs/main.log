	Everything appears to be compiling accurately in the new get_* for config options;
	Template A is outputting as exepected;
	Need to update HAS_DATATABLES corresponding modules to represent new configs;
		This inlcudes the files in /js/ and /css/.

	Currently working on importing css to header and building a template via config;
	All code appears to be compiling so far;
	Have not tested if there are run-time errors though...;
