	Form submission is up for logins;
	We are currently `under maintenace` as we have not configured the db;
	That being said, everything works even if the DB is compromised;
	TODO:
		add `tables` param to config to set cols;
		init tables via db_helper;
		do a verification if users exist in `users` table;
		init users via db_helper if no users found;
		Test Login!
	And once logins are up and running, consider next part of task.
		Either (A) Do Json parser or (B) Work on the design of the site via navbar and the such;

	Have everything in place to start initializing the db;
	Still working in /templates/login.php:
		Do a verification if the DB exists;
		Do a verification if the TABLES exist;
		Do a verification if USERS exist;
	After verification, act accordingly in making the db, making tables, or updating db;
	Once this is done, we should be in place for a navbar template;

	Everything appears to be compiling accurately in the new get_* for config options;
	Template A is outputting as exepected;
	Need to update HAS_DATATABLES corresponding modules to represent new configs;
		This inlcudes the files in /js/ and /css/.

	Currently working on importing css to header and building a template via config;
	All code appears to be compiling so far;
	Have not tested if there are run-time errors though...;
