	Have everything in place to start initializing the db;
	Still working in /templates/login.php:
		Do a verification if the DB exists;
		Do a verification if the TABLES exist;
		Do a verification if USERS exist;
	After verification, act accordingly in making the db, making tables, or updating db;
	Once this is done, we should be in place for a navbar template;

	Template A is outputting as exepected;
	Need to update HAS_DATATABLES corresponding modules to represent new configs;
		This inlcudes the files in /js/ and /css/.

	Currently working on importing css to header and building a template via config;
	All code appears to be compiling so far;
	Have not tested if there are run-time errors though...;
