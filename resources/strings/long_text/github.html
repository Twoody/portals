	<span class="first-word">Github</span> is the major component of every 
	software developers toolkit.

	<span class="first-word">Github</span> GUIs (Graphic User Interfaces)
	are another option for people who are afraid of the little black box.

	The benefit of using the GUI is only that there are less commands you
	will have to learn, and you can sit back in your chair and feel like you
	are using <span class="backdrop-facebook">facebook</span> while at work.
