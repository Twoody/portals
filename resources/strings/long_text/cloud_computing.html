	Cloud computing can mean several different things.
	Like most definitions in this world, different things are 
	returened depending on who you ask.
</p>


<p>
	"The Cloud" is the usual place to start. 
	And to build a website, you usually need to start with "The Cloud".
</p>

<p>
<p>
	To build a website, you will need a dedicated server that will be fast, 
	reliable, and secure. 
	Unless your skill set is going to be systems administrator and/or network 
	programmer, you probably do not want to worry about the 
	<pre class="terminal-block">
		$&nbsp;<kbd style="color:#00ef77;">sudo apachectl start</kbd>
	</pre>
	calls. 
	You will not want to worry about the
		<a href="https://letsencrypt.org" class="highlighter" target="_blank">
			letsEncrpy Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Certificates. 
		</a>
	You do not want to fandangle with email accounts and 16 years of 
	boilerplate code to 
	create another GUI to another bash processed sql bridge.
</p>

<p>
	By choosing someone to host your server for you, hours can be saved on your 
	project. 
	Having a server and space in "The Cloud" is like calling 
	<code>
		get_server('my-website.com'); 
	</code>
	in the game of life. It prevents the life user to 
	<code>
		my_computer = get_computer() 
	</code>
	It prevents the user to 
	<code>
		if(is_broken(my_computer)){my_computer = replace_computer();}. 
	</code>
</p>

<p>
	Now, that we understand what "The Cloud" is, we need to understand how to 
	interact with "The Cloud". 
	Essentially, you have tools like:
	<ol>
		<li>
			Github
		</li>
		<li>
			Github
		</li>
		<li>
			Github
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" class="highlighter" target="_blank">
			PuTTY (a free SSH and Telnet client)
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			Bash, the Terminal, and SSH
			<ol type="A">
				<li>
					Access Tokens
				</li>
				<li>
					SSH Key-Gen
				</li>
				<li>
					puTTY for Windows Users
				</li>
				<li>
					VIM (If new to programming, taking the time to learn <code>vim</code> now is 
					an exponential investment)
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>grep</code>, <code>find</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>mv</code>, 
					<code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.vimrc</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>man</code>, 
					<code>du</code>, <code>brew</code>, <code>choco</code>, <code>cat</code>, 
					<code>clear</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>git</code>, <code>piping</code>,
					AND MORE!
				</li>
				<li>
					<code>scp</code> and <code>rsync</code> (these get their own shoutout)
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			FileZilla and FTP for Windows Users
		</li>
		<li>
			Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
		</li>
		<li>
			Python, LaTex, Regex, Organizatino (i.e. DevOp Skills)
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	And then you have standards put together by organizations like OWASP and 
	ISO to keep everyone on the same page.
	For example, consider the date 
	<code>
		2019-04-05
	</code>
	and the date 
	<code>
		04-05-2019. 
	</code>
	Years of cultural influence and usage of putting the year last in our dates 
	has us thinking the second date is better.
	But us computer scientists like the first date better!
</p>

<p>
	And what about passwords and handling user information? What about user 
	authentification? What about Priviliges, Roles, 3rd party dependencies, 
	...? 
	<a href="https://www.owasp.org" class="highlighter" target="_blank">
		 Enter OWASP
	</a>
	.
</p>
<p>
	Let's look at the top three items above. <b>VERSION CONTROL IS THE 
	TOP ITEM FOR EVERYTHING.</b> Without version control, we might as well
	be running around a rat maze until we get so exhausted, we just stop. 
</p>
<p>
	It is at that point where most projects just go abandoned. But with
	version control, the user can go back and save the day for a contaminated
	database. The user can go back to a time when their files were not 
	corrupted and not compiling. I will cover this more in the github blog,
	<a class="highlighter"><b>which I would highly suggest looking at before 
	anything else if you identify as a beginner or github novice.</b></a>
</p>
<p>
	But before you go, there are three final concepts that we need to touch on.
	<ol>
		<li>
			<a class="highlighter" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service">
				Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a class="highlighter" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">
				Platform as a service (PaaS)
			</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a class="highlighter" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">
				Software as a service (SaaS)
			</a>
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<!---- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ---->
<p>
	<span class="first-word">IaaS</span>
	are servers meant to handle high level API calls online.  Consider a 
	company like PayPal where a shop can make an API call asking for money from 
	one account to be put into their account. Consider My Fitness Pal which can 
	look up recipes where 
		<code>get_calories_by_serving(recipe) &lt; _GET['calories']</code>
	. MFP and PayPal (along with practically every top tech company) has an 
	amazing API structure. And some companies ONLY have API's and databases. 
	The website is not their focus. Creating is not their focus. These 
	companies are 100% focused on databases.
</p>
<!---- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ---->
<p>
	<span class="first-word">PaaS</span>
	are servers meant to provide a <b>platform</b> where users can come and 
	create content. 
	<span class="highlighter">
		WYSIWIGS, Google App Engine, Oracle Cloud Platform are all examples of PaaS.
	</span>
	And there are many, many more. Within this group, we have five other 
	specific example:
	<ol>
		<li>
			Public Platforms
		</li>
		<li>
			Private Platforms
		</li>
		<li>
			Hybrid Platforms
		</li>
		<li>
			Communications Platforms
		</li>
		<li>
			Mobile Platforms
		</li>
		<li>
			Open Platforms
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	<span class="first-word">SaaS</span>
	. This is the holy grail. These companies offer their clients a service.
	Say the client has 10 gigs of data. Company Foo just made software 
	<code>bar.exe</code>.
	And this new software will take that 10 gig data import, process it, and
	spit out a website, which Company Foo has also taken care of for 
	hosting, security, and everything else. 
	<span class="highlighter">
		In this case, the client rarely sees the code that executes and
		does all of the work. Things just magically happen, and everyone
		appears to be left happy at the end of the day.
	</span>
	However, there is now <b>Open SaaS</b>, such as WordPress. Open SaaS
	gives clients at least the opportunity to validate the claims the
	seller are making;
