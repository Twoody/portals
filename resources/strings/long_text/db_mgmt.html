	<span class="first-word">Managing</span> a database involves insurance,
	knowledge of the softwares purpose and history, intricate foresight, focus
	on performace, and extensive experience within the databases:

	If you are trying to make your own website, and you feel like you do not need
	a database, I would kindly disagree. Databases go hand-in-hand with every piece
	of technology.

		If scalability is not a thought while coding, then it will never happen 
		within that developers lifetime, as long as they believe their products are 
		not good enough to be scaled to something larger.
	</span>
	And surprisingly enough, an application designed to be scaled larger is in
	fact easier to maintain and work with.

	Anyway, I digress. Databases are a fundamental part of user management,
	content management, settings and configuration, and more. The trick to
	utilizing databases for a task at hand is to keep all of the items normalized.
	For example, if making a database for a bookshop, consider the current
	architectures having one table with columns: 
	<ul>
		<li>
			"book title"
		</li>
		<li>
			"book price"
		</li>
		<li>
			"copies sold"
		</li>
		<li>
			"profit from sales".
		</li>
		<li>
			"books in stock".
		</li>
		<li>
			"cost spent per book".
		</li>
	<ul>
	In this example, the first red flag that I would spot in the table to make
	a check on is how the store is calculating their `profit from sales`.

	We can find the profit from already existing columns. By having a seperate 
	function to determine the profit gained per book, we decrease risk in terms 
	of versioning and keeping clean and stable code. If we need to update our 
	database at some point and move records around, we can check the version 
	of the `calculate_profits(book_id)` function was used.
