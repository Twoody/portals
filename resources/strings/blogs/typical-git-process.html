	<span class="first-word">Learning</span> <code>git<code> takes nothing more
	than patience. Do you know that the modern day keyboard we use for computers
	was predicted to fail miserably? No one thought that a person could possibly
	learn to punch all of the keys in a quick and efficient matter. We would 
	have to all be professional painist if we wanted to use a computer!
	<b>
		But here we are, in 2019, and the keyboard has more than set a precedent
		for how to operate with a computer.

	In this tutorial, I hope to explain to you a very typical workflow I go
	through while using the command line and <code>git</code>. In this 
	tutorial, I am going to be using my editor of choice, <code>vim</code>.
	<br/>
	Remember that there are multiple configurations and variables that can be 
	altered and changed from source to source.
	For example,I have my <kbd class="bash-green">~/.gitconfig</kbd> configured 
	to default to <code>vim</code>. On some servers, <code>git</code> will try
	to write <code>commit</code> messages in <code>nano</code> or <code>atom</code>.

	In my case, I want to test my website locally, know that everything works,
	and then have my working changes deployed directly to production with having
	zero down time. How can I accomplish this?
</p>
<p>
	If you answered "Just pull into master on prod.", then you are right! In three
	commands from the terminal, I can <code>ssh<code> into the server, 
	<code>cd<code> to the <kbd class="bash-green">.../.git</kbd> directory, and 
	finally <code>git pull</code> with an access token previously setup.
	<!-- TODO: LINK TO ACCESS TOKEN SETUP -->

			Note that the command <code>passtow</code> seen below is a 
			<code>bash alias</code> which is equivalent to:

			<code>ssh username@123.456.789.01</code>
