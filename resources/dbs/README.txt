Purpose:
	Explain some nuances and provide guidelines for specific language
	calls and expected functionality.

Nuances of init*.php files:
	Do they work? What do they do? Can they always be freely executed,
	or do these files lack validation and sanity checks?

Common Commands:
	Read and Execute a *.sql file:
		sqlite3 some.db
		sqlite> .read my_creates.sql;
