This rendition is going to focus on first bug fixes.
Focus will then shift to adding multiple balls;
Also need to make sure arrow movements align with rectangleDrag() and click;

Next Step:
	Bug Fixes;
	States and options from ../slanted-1/

Status:
	Working:
		Arrows to mimic drag & refractoring to Rectangles.js;
		Ball on top of rectangle is being given friction:
			Persistent bug such that the ball is not stopping
			vertical bouncing;
		Multiple balls appears to be working;
	Bugs:
		Ball is being squished for no reason by screen size changes;
		Ball acceleration is happening to much;
