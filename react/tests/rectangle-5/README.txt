This rendition is going to focus on first bug fixes.
Focus will then shift to adding multiple balls;
Also need to make sure arrow movements align with rectangleDrag() and click;

Next Step:

Status:
	Working:
		Arrows to mimic drag & refractoring to Rectangles.js;
		Ball on top of rectangle is being given friction:
			Persistent bug such that the ball is not stopping
			vertical bouncing;
	Not Working:
		Multiple balls has not started yet;
	Bugs:
