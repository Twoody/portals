This dir is setup to attempt at getting a working git and apache config
in place for hosting.

Right now, we are having a very ugly git log because we are serving build/
artifacts from a cp/paste state with the hashes;

And this is making for the serving of the files to be done wrong, I am sure.

Waiting to get feedback and help with this one.
