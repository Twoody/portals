A. Main:
	1. Figure out if there are some dead links and paths in config/paths.php
				For sure dead ones might me features and pricing from nav;
				Part of this is going to be changing:
					make_script()
					make_href()
					etc.
				, calls to make_tag();
	1. 	TEST functionaltiy of site when internet is back on;
				Flip CONFIG['IS_ONLINE']
				RESULTS:
					Everything seems to be working okay for online.
					However, while offline, the icons are not getting adjusted correctly.
					I believe this has to do with the browser automatically commenting
					out the <i>con tags and trying to do svg's instead;
					I will google a solution upon internet access;

	1. 	Design: Navbar, crumbles, media
	1.		Everywhere there is _POST, sanitize;
				**** **** DONE **** **** 
					But the weird thing is I was unable to sql inject when turning it off;
					TODO is to actually make an instance where I can inject;
					I am trying to inject on ./a/actions/viewport_users.php

	2. 	JSON parser
	3.		Datatable + submit form + reset_db() call for members to test sql injection;
	4.		HTTPS verification; SEE:
				https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3865143/what-do-i-have-to-code-to-use-https
	5.		Add a shopid to all of the get_inventory...
	N-3. 	sr-only + CURRENT status on navbar items
	N-2. 	Make images tied to DB for easier editing;
				End goal should be edit them with a pencil;
	N-1. 	Error handling via errors.json
	N. 	Design more templates...; LOW PRIORITY;

B. Database Items:
	2. 	Think about a pages.db and integration into pages that can be made and can be added to it;
	N. 	Store $CONFIG['TITLE'] in a pages db;

C. Navigation:
	2.		get current page from $config or $sessions;
	3.		Plug any strings into /resources/strings/ and parse out...

D. Users
	1.		`Remember Me` functionality;
	2.		In /u/settings/ let user see what owner they are affiliated with;

E. Random
